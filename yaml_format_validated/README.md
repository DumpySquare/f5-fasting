## ATC schema validation by file sub-type - YAML

If the RedHat YAML extension is installed and configured as described in the following doc:

https://github.com/DumpySquare/vscode-f5-fast/blob/master/README_docs/schemaValidation.md

The files in this directory, when opened with the vscode-f5-fast extension, should have schema validation related to the file sub-type, but in a yaml format

> NOTE: don't forget to use the json <-> yaml converter included with the extension!
